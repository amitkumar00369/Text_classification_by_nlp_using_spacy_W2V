# Text Classification using NLP Models

This README file provides an overview of how to perform text classification using various NLP (Natural Language Processing) models, including CountVectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer, SpaCy, and Gensim. We will focus on classifying text data into two categories: "Fake" and "Real" using labeled datasets.

## 1. Introduction

Text classification is a common NLP task where you categorize text documents into predefined classes or categories. In this guide, we will demonstrate how to perform text classification on a "Fake" and "Real" dataset using different NLP models.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: scikit-learn, spaCy, Gensim, and any additional libraries needed for your specific use case.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn spacy gensim
```

## 3. Data Preparation

To perform text classification, you need labeled data. In our case, we have a dataset with two classes: "Fake" and "Real." Ensure you have this dataset in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or text files).

## 4. Model Selection

### CountVectorizer

CountVectorizer is a simple method that converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts. It creates a bag of words representation for text data.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Implement your CountVectorizer-based text classification here.
```

### TF-IDF Vectorizer

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is another vectorization technique that reflects the importance of words in a document relative to a corpus.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Implement your TF-IDF Vectorizer-based text classification here.
```

### SpaCy

SpaCy is a popular NLP library that provides pre-trained models for various languages and NLP tasks.

```python
import spacy
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Implement your SpaCy-based text classification here.
```

### Gensim

Gensim is a library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis. It can also be used for text classification.

```python
import gensim.downloader import as API
wv=API.load("word2vec-google-300")

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Implement your Gensim-based text classification here.
```

## 5. Training and Evaluation

For each model, you should follow these general steps:

1. Load and preprocess your dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Apply the selected model to the training data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Fine-tune the model parameters as needed.

## 6. Conclusion

Text classification is a fundamental NLP task with numerous applications, including spam detection, sentiment analysis, and more. By following the steps outlined in this guide and experimenting with different NLP models, you can build effective text classifiers for your specific use cases.

Remember that the choice of model and preprocessing techniques depends on your dataset and problem domain. Experimentation and fine-tuning are essential for achieving the best results.
