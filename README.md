Data Preparation
Before you can start building your text classification model, you need to prepare your data. This involves loading your dataset, understanding its structure, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Text Preprocessing{
def preprocess_vector(text):
    doc=nlp(text)
    filtered_tokens=[]
    for token in doc:
        if token.is_stop or token.is_punct:
            continue
        filtered_tokens.append(token.lemma_)
        
    return wv.get_mean_vector(filtered_tokens)}
Text data often requires preprocessing to clean and transform it into a suitable format for machine learning. Common text preprocessing steps include:

Removing punctuation and special characters.
Tokenization (splitting text into words or tokens).
Removing stop words (common words like "and," "the," "in").
Stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their root form).
You can find the text preprocessing code in the src/text_preprocessing.py script. Modify it to suit your dataset and requirements.

Feature Extraction
To convert text data into a format suitable for machine learning models, you can use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and CountVectorizer. These methods convert text into numerical features that models can understand.

Model Selection
Choose machine learning algorithms suitable for your text classification problem. Common algorithms for text classification include:


Naive Bayes

Decision Trees
Random Forest
You can experiment with different algorithms to see which one performs best for your specific dataset.

Training the Model
Create a pipeline that combines text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. This pipeline ensures consistency and simplifies the process of training and evaluating different models. You can find an example of such a pipeline in the Jupyter notebook.

Evaluation
Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Use cross-validation to assess the model's robustness.

Deployment
Once you are satisfied with your model's performance, you can deploy it in a production environment. This may involve creating an API, integrating it into a web application, or using it in a batch processing pipeline.
